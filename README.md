# FolderExplorer
## The best way to figure out if that folder has anything in it, without actually having to open it!

### Use
Simply clone this repo, and use the shell of your choice to navigate to the repo.
Start the script using the command `bash FolderExplorer.sh`
Running the script on a target folder will produce a .md file (named after the target folder) in the current working directory.

### Options
Try using one of the following options for customized functionality:
-v|--version Display version information
-h|--help Display help information
-f|--file Use with an argument of the target folder location to analyze folders outside of the current directory.
